## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Every online store needs a shopping cart and a way to take payment from the customer. In this course, you'll build a storefront that lets customers make purchases. We'll focus on the data model, maintaining state for the customer's shopping cart. Then we'll integrate Braintree into our application for processing the financial transactions.
